# Open Source, Actively Maintained Web Apps for LLMs 游눫

LLM-based applications have many parts: Search backends, prompting systems, UIs, and more. To jump-start your project, this repository aggregates high-quality, functioning web applications for use cases including Chatbots, [Natural Language Interfaces](https://colinharman.substack.com/i/137091060/natural-language-interfaces-nli), Assistants, and Question Answering Systems. It compares projects along important dimensions for these use cases, to help you make the right choice.

To ensure the utmost quality and usability, projects must adhere to the following criteria to be included:

- Licensed under Open Source terms, specifically Apache or MIT 游눶
- Actively Maintained, meaning updated within the past month or under active monitoring 游뚿

The projects span a wide range of complexity, from straightforward API wrappers to production-ready systems with multi-source RAG backends, conversation logging, and authentication/user management. There should be something for almost every need.
